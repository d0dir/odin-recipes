            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, water, minced garlic, bay leaves, black peppercorns, and brown sugar (if using). Mix well.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken thighs to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.</li>
                <li>Heat cooking oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and brown the chicken on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.</li>   
                <li>Once the chicken is browned, pour in the reserved marinade. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
                <li>Remove the lid and continue to simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes, allowing the sauce to reduce and thicken slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
                <li>Serve the chicken adobo over steamed rice, garnished with chopped green onions.</li>
